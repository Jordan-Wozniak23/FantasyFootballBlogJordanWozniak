# Welcome to my Blog! {#sec-welcome}

Hello there, it is me, Jordan Wozniak. I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Iowa, majoring in Psychology. I also plan on going into a fifth year where I go on the road to achieve my masters, and get an associates in criminal justice, since I like the idea of the crime side of psychology.

# About Me {#sec-aboutMe}
